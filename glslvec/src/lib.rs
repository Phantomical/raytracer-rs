//! A vector math library which attempts to mostly replicate
//! the vector math functions available in GLSL.
//!
//! This means that all functions are free functions that
//! delegate their workings to an internal trait. If needed
//! those templates are available in the 
//! [prelude](prelude/index.html) module. They should only be
//! required if implementing new vector types.
